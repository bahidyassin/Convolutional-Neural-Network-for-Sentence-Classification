# Convolutional Neural Network for Sentence Classification:

###### Yassin Bahid

###### Abstract:
In the pursuit of a better text classification model, we choose to construct a sentence level neural network. We use Cornel's movie review database and fasttext vectorized word dictionary to vectorize the dataset. We train 3 different models using different embeding layers.
